# Interview project for TinyClues MLE Internship [My version]
I added to the repository a notebook containing both collaborative and content based methods for movie recommendation. I also did a data exploration before to understand the data.
The code also contains an implementation of a flask based api giving restults of both methods.
## How to use the api:
for the collaborative method: [GET]: /collaborative?user_id=USER_ID\
for the content based method: [GET]: /content?user_id=USER_ID&limit=LIMIT (the limit is optional).
